Topic: modeling polynomial vector matrices

Background:

Polynomials are a common form of expression in mathematics, usually used to represent an algebraic expression in one or more variables. They occupy an important place in several branches of mathematics, such as algebra, calculus, and numerical analysis. Polynomials have the base form of:

$$
P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0
$$
